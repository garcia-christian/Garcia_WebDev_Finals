           <h3>Anosmia (loss of smell) is a symptom</h3> 
           <p>The most commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, as the disease has spread around the world, healthcare providers have noticed a few unusual symptoms, including loss of smell (anosmia) and decreased sense of taste (ageusia).</p>

                <h3>SARS-CoV-2 binds tightly to human cells</h3>
                <p>In 2003, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, spread from Asia throughout the world, sickening more than 8,000 people and killing more than 700 over a six-month period. The virus that caused SARS (SARS-CoV) is similar to the one that causes COVID-19—both are types of coronaviruses—but researchers have recently discovered an important difference that may explain why the new coronavirus is so hard to stop: SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) binds 10 to 20 times more tightly to human cells than SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS).</p>

               <h3> Coronavirus can make babies seriously ill</h3>
               <p>Compared to adults, children appear much less likely to get sick if they contract the novel coronavirus. However, the very young (less than 1 year) appear to be more vulnerable to serious illness than older children. From the records of 2,143 Chinese children, nearly 11% of sick infants were seriously or critically ill, compared to 7% of children ages 1 to 5 years, 4% of children ages 6 to 15 and 3% of teenagers aged 16 and older. In the United States, from February 12 to April 2, less than 2% of cases were in children younger than 18 years. Of these pediatric cases, 15% were in children under 12 months.</p>
